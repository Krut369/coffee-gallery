# ​ Coffee Gallery

A minimalist **static gallery website** showcasing coffee-themed visuals—images and videos.  
Built using plain HTML and CSS for simplicity and ease of customization.

---

##  Features

- Clean, responsive layout for displaying images
- Separate optimized and unoptimized gallery pages (`index.html`, `gallery-unoptimized.html`) for testing performance
- Support for embedded videos (`.mp4`)
- Images and media files stored locally—no external dependencies

## Optimization Notes

* **`index.html`**: Designed for production—optimized layout, compressed images, or improved loading performance (if applied).

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add lazy loading for images/videos to improve performance.
* Include captions, lightbox gallery, or hover effects.
* Implement responsive design enhancements and better mobile support.
* Add minified CSS or frameworks for cleaner styling.

---

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Markup structure
* **CSS3** – Minimal styling
* No JavaScript or build tools—purely static.
